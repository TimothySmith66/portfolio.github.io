# portfolio.github.io
Most of my code has been adopted by Bootstrap.
What I am doing is creating a website that has my portfolio.
I created a Navbar that allows anyone on my site to navigate through the 3 pages. This navbar had to be linked to my pages n order for it to work.
The index.html is about my life and I had to include a photo and two paragraphs. 
The portfolio page is 5 photos that I linked to my page inside of a grid so it looks organized.
the contact.html page is about how to contact me. in this page I had to create a place where people can put in their email, name, and message.
